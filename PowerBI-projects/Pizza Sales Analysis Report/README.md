# üçï From Oven to Revenue: The Hot and Fresh Pizza Sales Scoop! 

## Overview:

Utilizing the pizza dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales/data) , I undertook an in-depth analysis of business's performance over the past year. Leveraging SQL for robust data retrieval and Power BI for dynamic visualization, the objective was to extract meaningful insights across key metrics essential for a comprehensive understanding business performance.

## KPI Requirement:

Let's analyze key performance indicators for pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. 
Added Measures:
* Total Revenue ‚Äì The sum of the total price of all pizza orders
* Average Order Value ‚Äì The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders
* Total Pizzas Sold ‚Äì The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold
* Total Orders ‚Äì The total number of orders placed.
* Average Pizzas Per Order - The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

## üìùSteps Performed:
1. **Database Creation:**
   - A new database was established by transferring data from an Excel to SQL. This process enabled seamless data integration for subsequent analysis.

2. **Data Integration with Power BI:**
   - The SQL database was linked to the Power BI dashboard, allowing for the retrieval of relevant data sets to be used in the subsequent analysis.

3. **Data Cleaning in Power BI:**
   - In Power BI Desktop, a comprehensive data cleaning process was undertaken, focusing on attributes such as "pizza_size" in the Power Query tab. This step aimed to enhance data accuracy and consistency.

4. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - Measures were created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions to establish key performance indicators (KPIs). This provided a foundation for evaluating and monitoring performance metrics.

5. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Two pages were crafted within the Power BI dashboard. These pages feature visually informative charts, with highlighting the best-selling pizzas, showcasing top performers, and the least favored pizzas, offering insights for potential improvements and inventory management.
   - Slicers , filters and more visualisation features were used to make it interactive and dynamic.
